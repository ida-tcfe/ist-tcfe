\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This laboratory assignment had as the main objective the analysis of the circuit in Figure~\ref{circuit}. That goal was achieved by performing a theoretical analysis, using {\bf Octave}, and a simulation, using {\bf Ngspice}.

In the tables \ref{error1_res}, \ref{error2_res}, \ref{error4a_res} and \ref{error4f_res}, it is possible to see the results obtained for the two initial parts of the analysis and for the one regarding the forced solution. It can be observed that the results presented for the theoretical analysis and for the simulation are equal. However, it is worth mentioning that the values presented have a limited precision. But still, the fact that the values are equal to at least 5 decimal points suggests that the models used to make the theoretical part are equivalent to the models {\bf Ngspice} used. This is also proved by resemblance of the graphs obtained.

The circuit is ``simple'' and contains only linear components, so large deviations were not anticipated.

All in all, the results obtained were very satisfactory.
