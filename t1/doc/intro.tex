% state the learning objective
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit made up of a two voltage soures (one dependent), two current sources (one dependent) and seven resistors. It can be seen in the Figure ~\ref{circuit} below.

In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. It is followed by a simulation of the circuit, in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the results of which are compared to the theoretical results. Finally, some considerations are made about this study in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

%In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. In Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the circuit is analysed by simulation, and the results are compared to the theoretical results obtained in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}. The conclusions of this study are outlined in Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.
