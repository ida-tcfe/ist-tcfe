\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This laboratory assignment had as the main objective the analysis of the circuit in figure \ref{circuit}. That goal was achieved by performing a theoretical analysis, using Octave, and a simulation, using Ngspice tool.

As it can be observed in table \ref{error_res}, the theoretical results ($V_t$) do not match perfectly the simulation results ($V_s$). However, the error is quite small, always inferior to $1\%$. The circuit is quite simple and it contains only linear components, so it was not expected that these errors would occur. They have probably arrived due to different number precision in calculations in the two tools used.
