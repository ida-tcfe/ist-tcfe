\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

\par After analysing the circuit we proceeded to the simulation using \bf{ngspice} in order to
compare the results with the theoretical predictions. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:op}

Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit
under analysis. Compared to the theoretical analysis results, one notices the
following differences: describe and explain the differences.

\begin{table}[h]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
		\hline    
		{\bf Name} & {\bf Value [A or V]} \\ \hline
		\input{../sim/op_tab}
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{Operating point. A variable preceded by @ is of type {\em current}
		and expressed in Ampere; other variables are of type {\it voltage} and expressed in
		Volt.}
	\label{tab:op}
\end{table}

\par As one can see there's a slight deviation in the values compared with previous calculations,
however this error is assumed to be caused by numerical propagated errors made when solving the linear 
system of equations. %There's also a certain random error...



%\subsection{Transient Analysis}

%Figure~\ref{fig:trans} shows the simulated transient analysis results for the
%circuit under analysis. Compared to the theoretical analysis results, one
%notices the following differences: describe and explain the differences.
