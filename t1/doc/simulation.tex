\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

After analysing the circuit we proceeded to simulate it using {\bf ngspice} in order to compare the results with the theoretical predictions. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:op}.

%Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis. Compared to the theoretical analysis results, one notices the following differences: describe and explain the differences.

	\caption{Operating point. The '$n$' variables represent the potencial difference determined at the nodes, compared to GND. The '$r$' variables correspond to the current flowing through each resistor, as depicted in Figure~\ref{node_fig}.}
