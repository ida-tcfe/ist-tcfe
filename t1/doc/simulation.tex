\subsection{Operating Point Analysis}

After analysing the circuit we proceeded to simulate it using {\bf ngspice} in order to compare the results with the theoretical predictions. The results are shown in Table~\ref{tab:op}.

%Table~\ref{tab:op} shows the simulated operating point results for the circuit under analysis. Compared to the theoretical analysis results, one notices the following differences: describe and explain the differences.

\begin{table}[h]

	\begin{tabular}{|l|r|}
		\hline    
		{\bf Name} & {\bf Value} \\ \hline

	\caption{Operating point. The '$n$' variables represent the potencial differnce determined at the nodes, compared to GND. The '$r$' variables correspond to the current flowing through each resistor, as depicted in Figure~\ref{node_fig}.}

\end{table}

As one can see there's a slight deviation in the values compared with previous calculations. However this error is assumed to be caused by numerical propagated errors made when solving the linear system of equations or simply due to floating point arithmetics. %There's also a certain random error...
