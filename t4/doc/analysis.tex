%As already mentioned, to perform the theoretical analysis of the circuit {\bf Octave} was used. With this tool, we simulated the sine wave of the circuit after going through the transformer. Then that wave goes through the full-wave rectifier. As already mentioned, this rectifier (using the ideal diode model) transforms the signal to its absolute value. Next, using the capacitor, the signal starts to really look like a DC voltage. In figure \ref{fig:acdcoc}, it is possible to observe the output voltage of the Envelope Detector. After an initial time, the voltage oscillates near 15V.
