%As already mentioned, to perform the theoretical analysis of the circuit {\bf Octave} was used. With this tool, we simulated the sine wave of the circuit after going through the transformer. Then that wave goes through the full-wave rectifier. As already mentioned, this rectifier (using the ideal diode model) transforms the signal to its absolute value. Next, using the capacitor, the signal starts to really look like a DC voltage. In figure \ref{fig:acdcoc}, it is possible to observe the output voltage of the Envelope Detector. After an initial time, the voltage oscillates near 15V.

%To study the circuit in figure \ref{circuit}, it was first performed an operating point analysis, OP, as it was explained in classes. In this DC analysis (the source is like a short-circuit), the capacitors have infinite impedance, so they behave like an open circuit. The fact that capacitor $C_O$ behaves like an open circuit implies that the DC final output voltage is equal to 0 V, like the DC initial voltage. Bearing this in mind, the capacitors and $R_{in}$ can be removed from the OP analysis. Using a Th√©venin's equivalent for the bias circuit makes the OP analysis quite simple. Considering first the common emitter, with the mesh analysis it is possible to observe that:

First, the real circuit was analised. As already mentioned, to perform the theoretical analysis of the circuit {\bf Octave} was used. This analysis was conducted considering a sine wave of amplitude 1 and phase 0 as the input. In order to compute the gain, the input impedance and the output impedance, the circuit was analised using phasors.

It is possible to observe that the OP-AMP is inserted in a non-inverting amplifier with resistive feedback loop. Considering the ideal model for the OP-AMP, the voltage in node 3 must be equal to voltage in node 2. Also, voltage in node 2 must be:

\begin{equation}
        V_2 = \frac{R_4}{R_4+R_5}V_6
\end{equation}
