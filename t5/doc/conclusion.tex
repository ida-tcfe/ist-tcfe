%This laboratory assignment had as the main objective the construction and analysis of an audio amplifier. The chosen design is present in figure \ref{circuit}. The goal was to maximise the voltage gain and the bandwidth at which the circuit operates at ``full capacity'', while minimising the cost and the lower cutoff frequency, preferably to less than $20\;Hz$, the lower limit of the audible range.
%The merit figure of our first circuit is: \input{../sim/merit}. For our second circuit, it's \input{../sim/merit_mb}.
%Some deviations between the simulation and theoretical results were expected, due to the different model used by {\bf Ngspice} for transistors. In the theoretical analysis, we used very simple models. These deviations can be observed not only in table \ref{error1_res}, but also by comparing figures \ref{vg} and \ref{fig:frequencyresp} and the gains and impedances computed.
%All in all, the objectives were met. With more time and a lengthier study, better results could be obtained, and other solutions implemented.
