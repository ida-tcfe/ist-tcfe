%This laboratory assignment had as the main objective the construction and analysis of an audio amplifier. The chosen design is present in figure \ref{circuit}. The goal was to maximise the voltage gain and the bandwidth at which the circuit operates at ``full capacity'', while minimising the cost and the lower cutoff frequency, preferably to less than $20\;Hz$, the lower limit of the audible range.
%The merit figure of our first circuit is: \input{../sim/merit}. For our second circuit, it's \input{../sim/merit_mb}.
%Some deviations between the simulation and theoretical results were expected, due to the different model used by {\bf Ngspice} for transistors. In the theoretical analysis, we used very simple models. These deviations can be observed not only in table \ref{error1_res}, but also by comparing figures \ref{vg} and \ref{fig:frequencyresp} and the gains and impedances computed.
%All in all, the objectives were met. With more time and a lengthier study, better results could be obtained, and other solutions implemented.

This laboratory assignment had as the main objective the construction and analysis of a bandpass filter, using an OP-AMP. In the laboratory, the circuit presented in figure \ref{circuit} was analysed. After, this circuit was simulated using {\bf Ngspice} and analysed theoretically using {\bf Octave}. In the following graph, the results obtained in the lab and the ones obtained with {\bf Ngspice} and {\bf Octave} are presented.

As it was expected, the different results show some deviations. Some possible reasons for the deviations of the experimental points were already given in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}. The deviations between the simulation and the theory are probably the consequence of the different model used for the OP-AMP. {\bf Ngspice} uses a quite complex model. On the contrary, for the theoretical analysis a very simple model was considered, in which the OP-AMP is ideal. As expected, the model used by {\bf Ngspice} is more realistic, so the simulated points come closer to the experimental points than the theoretical ones.

In the next table, the results for the simulation and the theory regarding the central frequency, the gain and the impedances are compared:
