%The objective of this laboratory assignment was to study a circuit made up of a two voltage sources (one dependent), two current sources (one dependent) and seven resistors. It can be seen in the Figure ~\ref{circuit} below.

%In Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, a theoretical analysis of the circuit is presented. It is followed by a simulation of the circuit, in Section~\ref{sec:simulation}, the results of which are compared to the theoretical results in the final section, Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}. Here, some  considerations are also made about this study, the results obtained and whether the goals were achieved.

%In order to conduct the theoretical study, the tool {\bf Octave} was employed. The simulation was run in {\bf Ngspice}. In order to numerically assess the results, a {\bf Python} {\it script} was also used.
