\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This laboratory assignment had as the main objective the construction and analysis of an AC/DC converter. The chosen design is present in figure Figure~\ref{acdc_ours}. The goal was to design a circuit capable of converting 230 V of AC with frequency of 50 Hz to 12 V of DC. The analysis of the circuit was achieved by performing a simulation, using {\bf Ngspice}, and a theoretical analysis, using {\bf Octave}. By analysing the results obtained, we conclude that we were able to achieve a good result, the output voltage is very near from 12V and as a small ripple. 

The merit figure of our circuit is: \input{../sim/merit}.
